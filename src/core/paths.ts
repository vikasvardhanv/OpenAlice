/**
 * Centralized filesystem path resolution.
 *
 * Two roots, distinguished by lifecycle owner:
 *
 *   USER_DATA_HOME    user-produced state (config, sessions, broker
 *                     git-like commits, brain files, etc.). Survives
 *                     app upgrades and reinstalls. In production, set by
 *                     the guardian (electron/main.ts) to a platform-
 *                     standard location like ~/Library/Application
 *                     Support/OpenAlice/. In dev (pnpm dev / pnpm
 *                     electron:dev), unset → falls back to repo root
 *                     so contributors see their working data.
 *
 *   APP_RESOURCES_HOME   files shipped with the app (default templates,
 *                        the UI bundle). Replaced wholesale on app
 *                        upgrade. In production: .app/Contents/Resources/.
 *                        In dev: unset → repo root.
 *
 * Why two homes: user data must survive .app deletion and version
 * upgrades, while app resources must be replaced cleanly on upgrade.
 * Conflating them either loses user data on upgrade or keeps stale
 * default templates around forever.

 * include `src/workspaces/templates/**` (currently DOES NOT — workspace
 * spawning will fail until that's added; tracked in TODO).
